## Inspiration
Thinking about the topic of the hackathon, we came up with an idea to connect people during this difficult time. Few minutes, and "Here & now" was born.

## What it does
With our solution, everybody can create their own virtual meeting on the map. Just search a place you want and start your room. You can choose any topic you want. Is it a project meeting? A sudden accident? Looking for a good restaurant? Just create it and start talking with people. You can also find an existing one and check what is going on.

## How we built it
All we needed was: 
- Frontend - React.js 
- Backend - Flask and API communication

## Challenges we ran into
- States of application. 
- Good-looking styles. 
- Creating elegant REST API. 
- Functional and real-time chat.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All of the problems we defeated! And we created a functional app :)

## What we learned
- Working in a squad. 
- Linking front-end and back-end. 
- Creating a nice web app. 
- Database administration.

## What's next for Here & now
After the hackathon we want to improve our solution with other cool features like private rooms, list of all events in the area, sharing files inside a room.
